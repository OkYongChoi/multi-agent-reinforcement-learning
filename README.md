## Table of Contents

### Environments

* **Matrix games**: The simplest stochastic game environments.
  * Climbing Game:

    | | | | |
    |-|-|-|-|
    | 11|-30| 0 |
    |-30| 7 | 6 |
    | 0 | 0 | 5 |

  * Penalty Game:

    | 0 | 2 | 0 |
    | K | 0 | 10|

* [Multi-agent particle environment (MPE)](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs): A simple multi-agent particle world with a continuous observation and discrete action space, along with some basic simulated physics.
  * Predator-prey, Coopertive navigation, Cooperative communication,Keep-away, Convert communication, Physical deception, etc.
